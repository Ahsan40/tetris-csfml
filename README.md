## Tetris CSFML

This is unfinished tetris project written in pure C with CSFML-2.3-2 library. It is under development. Obvious, it depends on csfml.

```
./bld
./main
```
Hit *Return* to start game.

__TODO:__

- "Game Over" with restart
- Levels and scores system with table of records
- Three next shapes
- Main menu with beauties
- Look with sprites
- Autotools script
