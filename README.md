This is unfinished tetris project written in pure C with CSFML library. It is under development. Obvious, it depends on csfml, but nothing more.

__Compilation__
```
make all
```
File named "tetris" is the final binary. Run it. Hit *S* to start game.

__TODO:__

- Levels speed and scores calibration
- Scores system
- Table of records
- Three next shapes
- Main menu with beauties
- Look with sprites
- Interprocess communication interface for control from other process (I want to connect machine learning algorithm and make it play and learn)
