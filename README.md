## Tetris CSFML

This is unfinished tetris project written in pure C with CSFML library. It is under development. Obvious, it depends on csfml, but nothing more.

__Compilation__
```
make all
```
File named "tetris" is the final binary. Run it. Hit *Return* to start game.

__TODO:__

- "Game Over" with restart
- Levels and scores system with table of records
- Three next shapes
- Main menu with beauties
- Look with sprites
